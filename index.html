                <!-- Add your description text here -->
                Dynamic mechanical engineer with a 7-year background in industrial automation, robotics, and
                communications. Evolving from mechanical applications engineer to technical sales role, I possess a diverse
                skill set and a proven track record in delivering innovative solutions through technology.
                Keenly interested in AI and at the forefront of emerging technologies, I recently completed a Data Science
                bootcamp in Python and am currently pursuing a Professional Certificate in Machine Learning and AI with
                Imperial College London Business School. This technical foundation fuels my enthusiasm for contributing to
                AI and ML solutions and staying abreast of the latest advancements in software development.
                With expertise in machine vision, industrial automation, and software solutions, I am adaptable and eager to
                contribute to diverse technical systems. Seeking roles that harness my programming expertise and passion
                for emerging technologies, I am well-positioned to drive innovation and contribute to cutting-edge solutions
                in various industries.
